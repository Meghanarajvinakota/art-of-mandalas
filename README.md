## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
The project goal is to create a user-friendly, responsive web application with seamless navigation to each page and from one art post to another as well as user feedback. The webpage allows visitors to explore arts that have been posted by the site admin, read more about the page and cotact page submit a contact form if they wish to be contacted .Logged in users will have access to the share page which will give options as well as the ability to add, update and delete their own arts and like other arts posted on the page.

### Agile Methodology
Epics were created to break down and group user stories which were then further broken down into tasks as steps to follow in the building process of the webpage. These were added to Project Boards on Github to assist with better organisation and prioritisation of the tasks in creating the webpage.
